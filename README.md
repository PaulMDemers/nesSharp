# nesSharp

A C# NES emulator project, currently in the first implementation milestone: cartridge loading, Mapper 0, CPU/bus scaffolding, and a headless test foundation.

## Current Commands

```powershell
dotnet test NesSharp.slnx
dotnet build NesSharp.slnx
dotnet run --project src\NesSharp.Cli -- info test-roms\nes-test-roms\other\nestest.nes
dotnet run --project src\NesSharp.Cli -- nestest test-roms\nes-test-roms\other\nestest.nes test-roms\nes-test-roms\other\nestest.log
```

## Current Status

- Parses iNES headers.
- Loads Mapper 0 / NROM cartridges.
- Supports NROM PRG mirroring, CHR ROM, CHR RAM, trainer skipping, and PRG RAM at `$6000-$7FFF`.
- Provides a CPU bus shell with internal RAM mirroring, PPU register mirroring, and cartridge space.
- Provides a CPU reset skeleton that reads the reset vector from cartridge ROM.
- Executes the 6502 official opcode set and the stable unofficial opcodes needed by `nestest`.
- Matches all 8,991 instruction states in `nestest.log` when started at `$C000`.
- Includes focused xUnit coverage using synthetic ROMs and the downloaded `nestest.nes`.

The staged implementation plan is in `docs/implementation-plan.md`.
